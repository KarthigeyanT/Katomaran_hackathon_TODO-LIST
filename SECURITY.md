## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

### How to Report

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security issues to: [karthigeyan.T](mailto:karthik.suthraye@gmail.com)
3. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Include steps to reproduce the issue
5. If applicable, include screenshots or proof of concept code

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards fixing the vulnerability
- After the vulnerability has been fixed, we will credit you in our security acknowledgments (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## 🔐 Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure authentication using Firebase Auth
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Session management with secure token handling
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Secure transmission using TLS 1.2+
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Input validation and sanitization

### Secure Development
- Regular dependency updates using `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`
- Security-focused code reviews
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Static code analysis with `flutter analyze`

### Environment Security
- Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- Separate configurations for development, testing, and production
- Secure storage of API keys and secrets

## 🛠️ Secure Development Guidelines

1. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `flutter pub outdated` to identify outdated packages
   - Prefer well-maintained packages with active development

2. **Code Practices**
   - Follow OWASP Mobile Top 10 guidelines
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Validate all user inputs

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Use `flutter_secure_storage` for sensitive data
   - Avoid storing sensitive information in shared preferences
   - Implement proper key management

4. **Network Security**
   - Enforce HTTPS for all network requests
   - Implement certificate pinning
   - Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

## 📝 Security Checklist for Pull Requests

- [ ] No sensitive data in code or commits
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Proper access controls in place
- [ ] Tests for security-related functionality

## 🚦 Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Contain** the incident to prevent further damage
2. **Assess** the impact and scope
3. **Mitigate** the vulnerability
4. **Notify** affected parties if necessary
5. **Document** the incident and response
6. **Review** and update security measures

1. Never commit sensitive information to version control
2. Always use environment variables for API keys and secrets
3. Keep dependencies up to date
4. Follow secure coding practices

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your API keys and secrets in `.env`
3. Never commit `.env` to version control

## Dependencies

Regularly update your dependencies using:
```bash
flutter pub outdated
dart pub upgrade
```
